# Georgia_Fatality_Analysis
This notebook uses GIS technique to analyse deaths of Geogia County using Geopandas 


### Question.
- Traffic safety is a major national concern in the transportation industry and the public in general. For instance, more than 36,000 people's lives are lost every year due to motor vehicle crashes and three million more people sustaining injuries in the United States. To prevent a crash to occur, their locations and causes must be well understood. This starts by identifying the hot spot areas with high crash rate or fatality. When the hot spot areas are identified, transportation officials evaluate the risky characteristics associated to develop effective and appropriate safety measures.


- I will use pandas and geopandas to perfom this analysis
